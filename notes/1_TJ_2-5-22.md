# Notes

## How to choose AWS Region

Factors that apply

- compliance: some countrys require data to be stored in the country or have
  other rules
- latency: for us to reach a server in Affrica, it will lag
- avalible services: not all services are avaliabe in all regions
- pricing: each region has specific pricing

## AWS Availability Zones

each region has between 2-6 zones each zone is a discreet data center separated
from eachother physicallys linked via high availbility networking

## AWS Global Services vs Region scoped

[region availability](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)

IAM is a Global Service EC2 is a regional service

Most services are regional resources ar scoped to a region

## IAM - Identity and Access Management

Default user is ROOT user

- don't use the root user
- don't share the root user

groups only contain users users don't need to belong to groups _not best
pratice_ users can be in multiple groups

IAM Policy - JSON -defines user/group permissions Apply least privilege
principle Root can do anything root should create admin that has most privligaes
and the only use root when needed

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17", // language version
  "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions", // Identifier for the Policy (optional)
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "1", // statment id (optional)
      "Effect": "Allow", // allow or deny
      "principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"] // account/user/role to which the pollicy is applied in this case root
      },
      "Action": ["ec2:Describe*"], // list of actions this pollicy affects
      "Resource": ["*"], // list of resources to which the action will be applied to, such as a bucket
      "condition": true // when this policy is in efect (optional)
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
        "cloudwatch:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### IAM Policies Inheritance

Q. What happens when you have policies that conflict?

### Access Key & Secret Access Keys

These are basicly alternate username/password pairs use for programatic access
